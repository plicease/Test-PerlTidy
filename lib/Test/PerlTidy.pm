=head1 NAME

Test::PerlTidy - check that all your files are tidy.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # In a file like 't/perltidy.t':

    use Test::PerlTidy;

    run_tests();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This rather unflattering comment was made in a piece by Ken Arnold:

    "Perl is a vast swamp of lexical and syntactic swill and nobody
    knows how to format even their own code well, but it's the only
    major language I can think of (with the possible exception of the
    recent, yet very Java-like C#) that doesn't have at least one
    style that's good enough."
              http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=74230

Hmmm... He is sort of right in a way. Then again the piece he wrote
was related to Python which is somewhat strict about formatting
itself.

Fear not though - now you too can have your very own formatting
gestapo in the form of Test::PerlTidy! Simply add a test file as
suggested above and any file ending in .pl, .pm, .t or .PL will cause
a test fail unless it is exactly as perltidy would like it to be.

=head1 REASONS TO DO THIS

If the style is mandated in tests then it will be adhered to.

If perltidy decides what is a good style then there should be no
quibbling.

If the style never changes then cvs diffs stop catching changes that
are not really there.

Readability might even improve.

=head1 HINTS

If you want to change the default style then muck around with
'.perltidyrc';

To quickly make a file work then try 'perltidy -b the_messy_file.pl'.

=head1 HOW IT WORKS

Runs B<perltidy> on files and reports errors if any of the files
differ after having been tidied.  Does not permanently modify the
files being tested.

By default, B<perltidy> will be run on files under the current
directory and its subdirectories with extensions matching:
C<.pm .pl .PL .t>

=head1 METHODS

=head2 run_tests ( [ I<%args> ] )

This is the main entry point for running tests.

A number of options can be specified when running the tests, e.g.:

    run_tests(
              path       => $start_dir,
              perltidyrc => $path_to_config_file,
              exclude    => [ qr{\.t$}, 'inc/'],
    );

=over 4

=item debug

Set C<debug> to a true value to enable additional diagnostic
output, in particular info about any processing done as a result of
specifying the C<exclude> option.  Default is false.

=item exclude

C<run_tests()> will look for files to test under the current
directory and its subdirectories.  By default, it will exclude files
in the "C<./blib/>" directory.  Set C<exclude> to a listref of
exclusion criteria if you need to specify additional rules by which
files will be excluded.

If an item in the C<exclude> list is a string, e.g. "C<./blib/>",
it will be assumed to be a path prefix.  Files will be excluded if
that string matches their path at the beginning.

If an item in the C<exclude> list is a regex object, e.g.
"C<qr{\.t$}>", files will be excluded if that regex matches their
path.

Note that the paths of files to be tested are canonified using
L<File::Spec|File::Spec>C<< ->canonpath >> before any matching is
attempted, which can impact how the exclusion rules apply.  If your
exclusion rules do not seem to be working, turn on the C<debug>
option to see the paths of the files that are being kept/excluded.

=item path

Set C<path> to the path to the top-level directory which contains
the files to be tested.  Defaults to the current directory (i.e.
"C<.>").

=item perltidyrc

By default, B<perltidy> will attempt to read its options from the
F<.perltidyrc> file on your system.  Set C<perltidyrc> to the path
to a custom file if you would like to control the B<perltidy>
options used during testing.

=item mute

By default, C<run_tests()> will output diagnostics about any errors
reported by B<perltidy>, as well as any actual differences found
between the pre-tidied and post-tidied files.  Set C<mute> to a
true value to turn off that diagnostic output.

=item skip_all

Set C<skip_all> to a true value to skip all tests.  Default is false.

=back

=head2 list_files ( [ I<start_path> | I<%args> ] )

Generate the list of files to be tested.  Generally not called directly.

=head2 load_file ( I<path_to_file> )

Load the file to be tested from disk and return the contents.
Generally not called directly.

=head2 is_file_tidy ( I<path_to_file> [ , I<path_to_perltidyrc> ] )

Test if a file is tidy or not.  Generally not called directly.
